WCF (Windows Communication Foundation) and WSDL (Web Services Description Language)
are both technologies used in the development of web services, but they serve different purposes.

WSDL:
WSDL is an XML-based language used for describing web services. It provides a standard format for 
defining the interface, operations, and data types of a web service. WSDL is used to describe the 
endpoints, methods, input/output messages, and protocols supported by a web service. It acts as a 
contract between the service provider and the service consumer, enabling interoperability between 
different platforms and programming languages. WSDL files are typically used in SOAP-based web services.

WCF:
WCF is a framework developed by Microsoft for building distributed systems and creating service-oriented 
applications. It provides a unified programming model for building web services, allowing developers to 
create services that can be accessed over various protocols such as HTTP, TCP, and MSMQ. WCF supports multiple 
communication patterns, including request/reply, one-way, duplex, and more. It also offers features like message 
security, reliable messaging, and transaction support.

WCF can use WSDL as part of its service description. When you create a WCF service, you can expose its metadata 
in the form of a WSDL document. This allows clients to discover and consume the service using the WSDL description.

In summary, WSDL is a language used to describe the structure and operations of a web service, while WCF is a 
framework that provides a programming model for building web services with additional features and flexibility. 
WCF can use WSDL to expose the service's metadata and enable interoperability with clients that understand the WSDL format.
